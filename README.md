# Java2DDrawings
This is a drawing application that I created for my CMPSC221 class at Penn State (Object Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications).  It allows the user to specify the shape, line type, and color, and allows them to draw on a white palette.  This project heavily utilizes the Swing framework.
